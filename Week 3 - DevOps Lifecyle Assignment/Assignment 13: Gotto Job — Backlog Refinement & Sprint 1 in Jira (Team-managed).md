- Turn the **Gotto Job template** into a value-ordered backlog  
- Estimate stories in **story points**  
- Plan **Sprint 1**  
- Use the **Burndown chart**  
- Ship a **small UI-only increment** (text/color/CTA — no backend)  

---

## Step 1 — Create the Project (3 min)
1. Jira: **Projects → Create project → Software development → Scrum → Use template → Team-managed → Create**  
2. Name:  
```

Gotto Job – Team <#>

```
(or *– <YourName>* for solo mode)  

---

## Step 2 — Create the Epic (2 min)
1. Open Backlog → toggle **Epics panel** → + Create Epic  
2. Epic Name:  
```

Improve Gotto Job UI discoverability & trust

```
3. Epic Summary:  
*Light, UI-only polish on listing, search, detail, and footer to improve clarity and credibility.*  

---

## Step 3 — Seed the Product Backlog (10–12 min)
Create **6–8 stories** under the Epic. Use **Fibonacci (1, 2, 3)** for estimates. Rank stories by value (drag in Backlog).  

### Suggested Stories
- **Hero tagline clarity (1 pt)**  
Headline: “Find your next role, fast.” (wraps cleanly on mobile)  
- **Primary CTA color (1 pt)**  
Change menu color to `#198754`, maintain contrast.  
- **Job card typography (2 pts)**  
Job titles larger & bolder on listings.  
- **“Remote” badge (2 pts)**  
Show “REMOTE” pill on flagged cards.  
- **Posted on <date> (1 pt)**  
Add static text: “Posted on <DD Mon YYYY>”.  
- **Advanced search labels (2 pts)**  
Clarify labels/placeholders for filters.  
- **Job detail “Apply Now” (1 pt)**  
Prominent button, focusable & clickable.  
- **Footer trust links (1 pt)**  
Add “About” and “Contact” links.  

---

## Step 4 — Planning Poker (8–10 min)
Estimate each story with **1/2/3 points**.  
- If debate needed, add quick notes in the story.  

---

## Step 5 — Sprint Planning (10–12 min)
1. Create **Sprint 1 (1 week)**  
2. Sprint Goal (example):  
```

Ship 2–3 visible UI improvements to Gotto Job and show them live.

```
3. Move **3–4 stories** (~5–6 points) into Sprint 1.  
4. Break stories into subtasks:  
- Build  
- Verify  
- Deploy  
- Screenshot  

---

## Step 6 — Reports → Burndown (2–3 min)
Go to **Reports → Burndown Chart**.  
⚠️ Screenshot at the end of the sprint when it populates.  

---

## Step 7 — Ship One Small Increment (15–20 min)
Pick **1 small UI story** (e.g., tagline, color, or CTA).  
- Implement it (text/color only)  
- Deploy to your host (EC2 or static hosting)  
- Provide proof: **live URL + before/after screenshots**  

---

## Step 8 — Retro Notes (2–3 min)
In a **comment on Sprint or Epic**, write:  
- 1 thing that went well  
- 1 thing to improve  
- 1 Scrum **pillar** (Transparency / Inspection / Adaptation) you observed  
- 1 Scrum **value** (Openness / Focus / Commitment / Courage / Respect) with a short example  

---

## Time Box (Reference)
- Setup (roles, project, fields): 8–9 min  
- Backlog refine + estimates: 20–22 min  
- Sprint planning + filters + burndown: 15–18 min  
- Build/deploy increment: 15–20 min  
- Retro + screenshots: 5–6 min  
- Presentations: 5 min per team (if live)
